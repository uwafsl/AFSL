    ABSTRACT = {Searching for a target in a complex environment is a common problem encountered by many autonomous systems.
    This work considers the problem of searching for targets using a team of heterogeneous agents.  The system maintains a
    grid-based world model which contains information about the probability that a target is located in any given cell of
    the map.  Agents formulate control decisions for a fixed number of time steps using a modular algorithm that allows for
    individual capabilities and characteristics of individual agents to be encoded in several parameters.  This paper
    investigates one aspect of the search strategy and presents a solution that guarantees total map coverage.  The resulting
    search patterns executed by agents guarantee an exhaustive search of the map in the sense that all cells will be searched
    sufficiently to ensure that the probability of a target being located in any given cell is driven to zero.},

    ABSTRACT = {The goal of most current Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) research is to
    develop algorithms which allow a single agent or possibly a team of
    agents to operate completely autonomously without human interaction.
    Most of these autonomous algorithms operate at a high, strategic
    level and assume that low level tasks such as state stabilization
    and signal tracking have already been realized.  The difficulty in
    verifying and validating strategic algorithms in an actual flight
    test is that implementing these algorithms require the development
    of many other lower-level subsystems which are not directly related
    to the strategic algorithms.  This paper presents both an
    architecture and hardware implementation of a ground based,
    distributed testing environment that is used in the Autonomous
    Flight System Laboratory to test strategic level algorithms in an
    efficient manner.  This system allows human interaction at very
    specific points to avoid developing a fully autonomous system, but
    still preserves the function and contributions of the strategic
    algorithm. This architecture and ground based testing facility
    greatly reduces development time and allows algorithms to be tested
    with little approximations before implementing them on a fully
    autonomous system.},

    ABSTRACT = {In typical search missions, the environment and the targets are not
    stationary and previous observations become less reliable as time
    progresses.  In addition, the search is often initiated with only a
    rough idea of target location.  In this work we consider a strategy
    for searching using a team of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. The
    team members maintain a world model which includes the estimate of
    possible target states. The issue of compelling agents to converge
    on targets and to search unexplored regions is formulated as a model
    predictive control problem.  The world model is propagated in time
    and strategic decisions are made autonomously based on its
    prediction.  Agents formulate control decisions by optimizing an
    objective function which allows for control and timing constraints.
    Individual agents in the team are coupled to one another through the
    centralized occupancy based map. This coupling, in combination with
    the outlined search strategy, leads to an efficient, autonomous, and
    cooperative search.},

    Unfortunately, no location sensor takes perfect measurements or works well in all situations.
    So, it is crucial to represent uncertainty in sensed location information and combine
    information from different types of sensors. Bayesian-filter techniques provide a powerful
    statistical tool to help manage measurement uncertainty and perform multisensor fusion and
    identity estimation. In this article, the authors survey Bayes filter implementations and
    show their application to real-world location estimation tasks common in pervasive computing.}

    ABSTRACT = {Accurate recognition and tracking of human activities is an important goal of ubiquitous computing.  Recent advances
    in the development of multi-modal wearable sensors enable us to gather rich datasets of human activities.  However, the problem
    of automatically identifying the most useful features for modeling such activities remains largely unsolved.  In this paper we
    present a hybrid approach to recognizing activities, which combines boosting to discriminatively select useful features and learn
    an ensemble of static classifiers to recognize different activities, with hidden Markov models (HMMs) to capture the temporal
    regularities and smoothness of activities.  We tested the activity recognition system using over 12 hours of wearable-sensor data
    collected by volunteers in natural unconstrained environments.  The models succeeded in identifying a small set of maximally
    informative features, and were able to identify ten different human activities with an accuracy of 95%.},

    which guarantees all vehicles remain free of collisions while attempting to attain their trajectory goals (given certain
    restrictions on their initial conditions).  This controller is reactive and decentralized, making it well suited for real time
    applications, and explicitly accounts for actuation limits.  Results are demonstrated in simulation.}

    task using intervehicle communication to coordinate their actions.  Tools from algebraic graph theory
    prove useful in modeling the communication network and relating its topology to formation stability.
    We prove a Nyquist criterion that uses the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix to determine the
    effect of the communication topology on formation stability.  We also propose a method for decentralized
    information exchange between vehicles.  This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each
    vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion.  Wee prove a separation principle
    that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of the is achieved information flow
    for the given graph and stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller.  The information
    flow can thus be rendered highly robust to changes in the graph, enabling tight formation control despite
    limitation in intervehicle communication capability. }

    ABSTRACT = {A simple model for synchronous firing of biological oscillators based on Peskin's model of
    the cardiac pacemaker is studied.  The model consists of a population of identical integrate-and-fire
    oscillators.  The coupling between oscillators is pulsatile: when a given oscillators fires, it pulls
    the others up by a fixed amount, or brings them to the firing threshold, whichever is less.  The main
    result is that for almost all initial conditions, the population evolves to a state in which all the
    oscillators are firing synchronously.  The relationship between the model and real communities of
    biological oscillators is discussed; examples include populations of synchronously flashing fireflies,
    crickets that chirp in unison, electrically synchronous pacemaker cells, and groups of women whose
    menstrual cycles become mutually synchronized.}

    and switching topologies.  We analyze three cases: i. directed networks with fixed topology, ii.
    directed networks with switching topology, and iii. undirected networks with communication time-delays
    and fixed topology.  We introduce two consensus protocols for networks with and without time-delays and
    provide a convergence analysis in all three cases.  We establish a direct connection between the algebraic
    connectivity (or Fiedler eigenvalue) of the network and the performance (or negotiation speed) of a linear
    consensus protocol.  This required the generalization of the notion of algebraic connectivity of undirected
    graphs to digraphs.  It turns out that balanced digraphs play a key role in addressing average-consensus
    problems.  We introduce disagreement functions for convergence analysis of consensus protocols.  A
    disagreement function is a Lyapunov function for the disagreement network dynamics.  We proposed a simple
    disagreement function that is a common Lyapunov function for the disagreement dynamics of a directed network
    with switching topology.  A distinctive feature of this work is to address consensus problems for networks
    with directed information flow.  We provide analytical tools that rely on algebraic graph theory, matrix
    theory, and control theory.  Simulations are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical
    results.}

    MAV teams are able to initialized and maintain controlled formations geometries, effectively forming a sensor
    web despite the lack of centralized leadership.  Results demonstrate the ability of a twenty-MAV team to
    accurately assemble in a grid formation when all vehicles are initialized in sufficient proximity to enable
    a (directed) information exchange topology that spans the MAV network.  Without such connectivity, MAV
    sub-groups form, each of which assembles a smaller version of the original grid formation.}

    topologies.  The consensus protocol is then applied to achieve altitude alignment among a team of
    micro air vehicles as an illustrative example.}

     guidance, navigation and control of UAVs.  From the early years of flying the Army Autonomous Scout
     Rotorcraft Testbed (ASRT) to the current Yamaha R-Max unmanned helicopter in multi-UAV flight tests,
     the UAV lab has gained much experience in flight testing of new technologies, and through this experience
     has devised procedures and tools to ensure that these flight tests are productive and carried out
     with stringent safety measures.  Specifically, the software tools developed in the lab allow researchers
     to run software in the loop (SITL) and hardware in the loop (HITL) tests on their work that simulate the
     actual flight of the vehicle being flown to a very high degree of accuracy.  SITL tests are used for
     initial verification of new algorithms, later HITL tests verify communication and functionality of all
     hardware components prior to flight.  This paper gives an overview of the systems used in the lab and
     the procedures that lead up to flight testing the algorithms developed.}

    UAVs to autonomously allocate a set of targets among the team and fly to the targets while avoiding designated
    areas.  A distributed architecture was used maximizing the benefits of increased autonomy in the areas of
    task allocation and path planning.  The real-time decision making component consists of the Evolution-based
    Cooperative Planning System (ECoPS) developed under DARPA funding.  The approach was demonstrated in simulations
    and in a flight test at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.}

    petroleum and mining industries. The result of a two-year cooperative research and development
    program between The Insitu Group and Fugro Airborne Surveys, these stateof-the-art Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles complement traditional manned airborne magnetic aircraft. Specifically, these Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles provide safe and efficient alternatives for data acquisition offshore, at low
    altitudes and in remote or harsh locations. Capable of fully autonomous 3D flight, the GeoRanger
    has an endurance of over 10 hours and cruises at 75 kilometers per hour. Using the point-location
    launch and recovery systems (patents pending), the GeoRanger can be operated from undeveloped sites
    in close proximity to survey areas. The advanced technology of the GeoRanger includes features such
    as full error-analysis capability, providing a return-to-base command in the event of difficulties
    while in flight and Iridium satellite communications providing the operator with continuous system
    status, position and velocity updates. This paper discusses market impetus, development, and
    operational success of GeoRanger in Canada including analysis of data quality which is comparable
    to conventional survey aircraft.},

    toward and perceive are represented as determinate in our experience of them.  A proper phenomenology of
    perception and action, however, shows that we experience objects indeterminately when we are perceiving
    them or moving toward them.  This indeterminacy, as it relates to simple movement and perception, is
    captured in the proposed phenomenologically based recurrent network models of brain function.  These models
    provide a possible foundation from which predicative structures may arise as an emergent phenomenon without
    the position of a representing subject.  These models go some way in addressing the dual constraints of
    phenomenological accuracy and neurophysiological plausibility that ought to guide all projects devoted to
    discovering the physical basis of human experience.}

    called folding is discussed for conditioning training sets optimally for training feed-forward
    neural networks to process characteristic fringe patterns.  Folding allows feed-forward nets to
    be trained easily to detect damage-induced vibration-displacement-distribution changes as small
    as 10 nanometers.  A specific application to aerospace of neural net processing of characteristic
    patters is presented to motivate the conditioning and optimization effort.}

        YEAR = {1997},
       PAGES = {26-33},
       MONTH = {January},
    ABSTRACT = {The theoretical development of a direct adaptive tracking control architecture using neural
    networks is presented.  Emphasis is placed on utilization of neural networks in a flight control
    architecture based on feedback linearization of the aircraft dynamics.  Neural networks are used to
    represent the nonlinear inverse transformation needed for feedback linearization.  Neural networks may
    be first trained off line using a nominal mathematical model, which provides an approximate inversion
    that can accommodate the total flight envelope.  Neural networks capable of on-line learning are required
    to compensate for inversion error, which may arise from imperfect modeling, approximate inversion, or
    sudden changes in aircraft dynamics.  A stable weights adjustment rule for the on-line neural network is
    derived.  Under mild assumptions on the nonlinearities representing the inversion error, the adaptation
    algorithm ensures that all of the signals in the loop are uniformly bounded and that the weights of the
    on-line neural network tend to constant values.  Simulation results for an F-18 aircraft model are
    presented to illustrate the performance of the on-line neural network based adaptation algorithm.}

       PAGES = {896-910},
       MONTH = {November},
    ABSTRACT = {A flight control design is presented that combines model inversion control with an
    online adaptive neural network (NN).  The NN cancels the error due to approximate inversion.
    Both linear and nonlinear NNs are described.  Lyapunov stability analysis leads to the online
    NN update laws that guarantee boundedness.  The controller takes advantage of any available knowledge
    for system inversion, and compensates for the effects of the remaining approximations.  The result
    is a consistency in response which is particularly relevant in human operation of some unconventional
    modern aircraft.  A tiltrotor aircraft is capable of converting from stable and responsive fixed
    wing flight to sluggish and unstable hover in helicopter configuration.  The control design is
    demonstrated to provide a tilt-rotor pilot with consistent handling qualities during conversion
    from fixed wind flight to hover.}

    populations of solutions.  Instead they update an explicitly parameterized probability distribution
    p over the space of solutions.  That updating of p arises as the optimization of a functional of p.
    The functional is chosen so that any p that optimized it should be p peaked about good solutions.
    The PC approach has deep connections with both game theory and statistical physics.  We review the
    PC approach using its motivation as the information theoretic formulation of bounded rationality
    for multi-agent systems (MAS).  It is then compared to GA's on a diverse set of problems.  To
    handle high dimensional surfaces, in the PC method investigated here p is restrict to a product
    distribution.  Each distribution in that product is controlled by a separate agent.  The test
    functions were selected for their difficulty using either traditional gradient descent or genetic
    algorithms.  On these functions the PC-based approach significantly outperforms traditional GA's
    in both rate of descent, trapping in false minima, and long term optimization.}

    ABSTRACT = {Autonomous Robotic Systems are often tasked in the role of actively searching to find a target
    or set of targets which are to be either rescued, observed, or destroyed.  In carrying out these missions,
    the vehicle must be capable of dealing with dynamic and possibly adversarial environments, which tend to
    foil or disrupt its intentions.  As a step in this direction, this paper describes the application of a path
    planning technique rooted in simulated evolution to a number of scenarios of increasing complexity, which
    attempt to model various aspects of such an environment.  The results presented illustrate the ability of
    this algorithmic approach to efficiently search simultaneously in space and time to deliver feasible, near-optimal
    solutions to problems involving varying terrain, dynamic obstacles, and moving targets.  In doing so, we highlight
    the features of the evolution-based approach which make it particularly attractive for handling environments of
    arbitrary complexity.}

    while avoiding obstacles by a safety margin and respecting constraint on velocity and acceleration.
    We consider the simplified case of a point mass under Newtonian mechanics together with velocity and
    acceleration bounds.  The point must be flown from a start to a goal amidst polyhedral obstacles in
    2D or 3D.  Although exact solutions to this problem are not known, we provide the first provably good
    approximation algorithm, and show that it runs in polynomial time.}

    ABSTRACT = {This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also
    known as trajectory planning or trajectory design).  The task is to determine control inputs
    to drive a robot from an initial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity
    while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot's environment.
    The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of
    the robot's high-dimensional configuration space.  Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning
    problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and
    obstacle-based global constraints.  The state space serves the same role as the configuration space
    for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply
    to planning trajectories in the state space.  The authors have developed a randomized planning approach
    that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces.  The
    basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits
    that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to
    a much broader class of problems.  Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given.  Experimental
    results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites
    in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.}

    advantage of the flexibility of EC-based techniques and the distributed structure of

    ABSTRACT = {Adaptive and intelligent on-board path planning is a required part of a fully
    autonomous UAV.  In controlled airspace, such a UAV would have to interact with other vehicles
    moving through its environment.  The locations of obstacles (other vehicles) that form
    obstructions in the environment may only be known with limited accuracy.  Evolutionary
    algorithms (EA) have been successfully used to compute near-optimal paths through obstructed,
    dynamically changing environments.  Explicitly accounting for the uncertainty o the obstacles
    can result in the survival of "best" paths which differ from those that would be favored in a
    purely deterministic environment.  In this paper, we consider the application of evolution-based
    path planning to the motion of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) through a field of obstacles at
    uncertain locations.  We begin with the static form of the EA algorithm for generating a path
    at a single point in time.  We describe the algorithm and show its behavior, specifically how
    it responds differently based on the known accuracy of the predictions of the environment.  We
    then show how the static structure can be extended to consider the uncertainties which change
    with time.  We demonstrate by application to path planning through a field of moving obstacles
    whose future motion is uncertain.}

    results in constant line-of-sight orientation of the target relative to the aircraft body frame.
    Using minimal heuristics, a guidance law based on "good helmsman" behavior is developed and implemented,
    and stability of its integration with aircraft dynamics is assessed.  An observer estimates wind data,

    we propose a new set of search protocols for teams of sensor-enabled mobile robots.  The focus is on collaborative strategies
    for the search of potential fields that are possibly time varying.  We pose the problem of quickly finding regions where the
    potential achieves or exceeds a certain threshold.  The search protocol has two distinct components.  In an "exploration
    phase", agents execute either a randomized or structured search, seeking places where the field achieves or exceeds the
    prescribed threshold.  Once a threshold point is reached, the "exploration" component is initialized and the agents deploy
    so as to rapidly map the evolving isoline associated with the given value of the4 field.  Conservative strategies will
    emphasize refining the detailed knowledge of the field in a small neighborhood of the isoline, while aggressive strategies
    will emphasize wide-ranging exploration of neighboring territory.  The main decision problem under study involves finding
    the optimally aggressive exploration strategy.  Additionally, the problem of the allocation of the agents between "exploration"
    and "exploitation" is considered.  A performance metric is developed to compare the proposed methods with standard approaches
    such as a random search and distributed raster scans.}

     presents a new approach to predict the value of future information by evaluation the most likely future measurement

     if additional observations were available.  Numerical results rare shown that demonstrate the improvement that can be

    that handles general PDF's is developed.  The channel filter assumers that complete global information is recovered

    the map for planning a benchmark set of routes.  This quality metric is then used to evaluate the results of exploration
    experiments.  Wall-following is tested as a n exploration strategy.  The experimental results show that it is a robust
    strategy but that it can be inefficient unless knowledge from the developing map is used in addition to the immediately-available

    localization scheme is introduced and added to the wall-following.  The peak quality is then 89 percent after 755 seconds.  "Supervised
    Wall-Following' is then implemented and tested.  A supervisory process monitors the developing map for exception conditions.
    When an exception arises the supervisor may change the parameters which control the wall-following (e.g. the step size) or to
    move directly to a new location (e.g. to eliminate repetitive loops).  With the supervisor in place, the quality peaks at 91 percent

    on two inter-dependent tasks: (i) on-line learning of the environment and storing of the information in the

    guidance trajectory for the agents to follow.  The distributed learning and planning approach for cooperative

    ABSTRACT = {When monitoring spatial phenomena with wireless sensor networks, selecting the best sensor
    placements is a fundamental task. Not only should the sensors be informative, but they should also be
    able to communicate efficiently. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach that addresses the
    three central aspects of this problem: measuring the predictive quality of a set of sensor locations
    (regardless of whether sensors were ever placed at these locations), predicting the communication cost
    involved with these placements, and designing an algorithm with provable quality guarantees that
    optimizes the NP-hard tradeoff. Specifically, we use data from a pilot deployment to build non-parametric
    probabilistic models called Gaussian Processes (GPs) both for the spatial phenomena of interest and for
    the spatial variability of link qualities, which allows us to estimate predictive power and communication
    cost of unsensed locations. Surprisingly, uncertainty in the representation of link qualities plays an
    important role in estimating communication costs. Using these models, we present a novel, polynomial-time,
    data-driven algorithm, pSPIEL, which selects Sensor Placements at Informative and cost-Effective Locations.
    Our approach exploits two important properties of this problem: submodularity, formalizing the intuition
    that adding a node to a small deployment can help more than adding a node to a large deployment; and locality,
    under which nodes that are far from each other provide almost independent information. Exploiting these
    properties, we prove strong approximation guarantees for our pSPIEL approach. We also provide extensive
    experimental validation of this practical approach on several real-world placement problems, and built a
    complete system implementation on 46 Tmote Sky motes, demonstrating significant advantages over existing
    methods.}

    mutual information is NP-complete. To address this issue, we describe a polynomial-time approximation
    that is within (1 - 1/e) of the optimum by exploiting the submodularity of our criterion. This algorithm

    ABSTRACT = {This paper addresses the design of mobile sensor networks for optimal data collection.  The development is
    strongly motivated by the application to adaptive ocean sampling for an autonomous ocean observing and prediction system.
    A performance metric, used to derive optimal paths for the network of mobile sensors, defines the optimal data set as one
    which minimizes error In a model estimate of the sampled field.  Feedback control laws are presented that stably coordinate
    sensor on structured tracks that have been optimized over a minimal set of parameters.  Optimal, closed-loop solutions are
    computed in the number of low-dimensional cases to illustrate the methodology.  Robustness of the performance to the influence
    of a steady flow field on relatively slow-moving mobile sensors is also explored.}

    ABSTRACT = {It is a challenging task to develop effective and efficient appearance models for robust object tracking due to factors such as pose variation, illumination change, occlusion, and motion blur. Existing online tracking algorithms often update models with samples from observations in recent frames. While much success has been demonstrated, numerous issues remain to be addressed. First, while these adaptive appearance models are data-dependent, there does not exist sufficient amount of data for online algorithms to learn at the outset. Second, online tracking algorithms often encounter the drift problems. As a result of self-taught learning, these mis-aligned samples are likely to be added and degrade the appearance models. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective and efficient tracking algorithm with an appearance model based on features extracted from the multi-scale image feature space with data-independent basis. Our appearance model employs nonadaptive random projections that preserve the structure of the image feature space of objects. A very sparse measurement matrix is adopted to efficiently extract the features for the appearance model. We compress samples of foreground targets and the background using the same sparse measurement matrix. The tracking task is formulated as a binary classification via a naive Bayes classifier with online update in the compressed domain. The proposed compressive tracking algorithm runs in real-time and performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on challenging sequences in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness.},

    ABSTRACT = {This work presents a solution to localize Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles with respect to
pipes and other cylindrical elements found in inspection and maintenance tasks both in industrial and
civilian infrastructures. The proposed system exploits the different features of vision and laser based
sensors, combining them to obtain accurate positioning of the robot with respect to the cylindrical
structures. A probabilistic (RANSAC-based) procedure is used to segment possible cylinders found
in the laser scans, and this is used as a seed to accurately determine the robot position through
a computer vision system. The priors obtained from the laser scan registration help to solve the
problem of determining the apparent contour of the cylinders. In turn this apparent contour is used
in a degenerate quadratic conic estimation, enabling to visually estimate the pose of the cylinder.},

    ABSTRACT = {This study describes a novel, vision-based system for guidance of UAVs. The system uses two cameras, each associated with a specially-shaped reflective surface, to obtain stereo information on the height above ground and the distances to potential obstacles. The camera-mirror system has the advantage that it remaps the world onto a cylindrical co-ordinate system that simplifies and speeds up range computations, and defines a collision-free cylinder through which the aircraft can pass without encountering obstacles. The result is a computationally efficient approach to vision-based aircraft guidance that is particularly suited to terrain and gorge following, obstacle avoidance, and landing. The feasibility of the system is demonstrated in laboratory and field tests.},
