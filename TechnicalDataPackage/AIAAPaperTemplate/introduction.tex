\textcolor{red}{LS to talk about about what we are trying to do and why this is difficult}

% What is the drogue
The purpose of this project was to design a pressure measurement system external to the aircraft. This system will be referred to as the drogue. The drogue was designed to be towed behind an aircraft in the free-stream air. The pressure measurements taken by the drogue were intended to be the true static and total pressure at a given altitude, as opposed to the measurements taken by the aircraft which are influenced by the aircraft itself. These true pressure measurements would then be used to calibrate the aircraft's pressure measurement instruments during flight tests of the aircraft.\\  

This drogue was intended to be an upgrade of the current static pressure measurement systems used during flight testing. The requirements for the drogue as laid out at the onset of this project focused on maintaining the accuracy and flight test length while reducing the modifications necessary to use the new system. Specifically, the drogue was required to measure the static pressure within 90\% accuracy of the current system in addition to tying with the data acquisition systems used currently and having power for up to four hours of flight time. In addition, the new design must be usable on Part 23-25 aircraft, be usable at all of the speeds these aircraft are tested, and require fewer modifications to install than the current systems.\\

From these requirements, additional specifications were drawn. In order to reduce the attachment modifications, the drogue must be a self-contained system. All pressure transducers and power systems must be within the drogue itself. In addition, the winch system which would reel the drogue in and out must be located in the drogue. In order to retain the current accuracy of pressure measurements, the body of the drogue must have a low pressure influence where ever the pressure was measured from. The drogue must also make minimal movements while in flight which would reduce the accuracy of the pressure measurements. This could be fulfilled either by natural stability or an active control system. A wireless transmission system must be used for real time transferal of the pressure measurements and the drogue must have a way of locating its position relative to the aircraft.\\
