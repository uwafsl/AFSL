This paper describes the design, manufacturing, testing, and evaluation of an automated trailing pressure measurement system for Part 23 and Part 25 aircraft flight testing. The primary goal of the system  is to measure static and total pressure of the atmospheric conditions of aircraft being subjected to Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) certification. The system utilizes a series of pitot tubes that relay information to a Paroscientific Series 2000 Absolute Pressure Transducer and a Honeywell Precision Differential Pressure Transducer. In addition to detailing the engineering design of the drogue, this paper outlines the testing campaign to validate its functionality.
